# multithreaded-factorials-c
Using pthreads, quickly calculates factorials of numbers in the range 1-20 inclusive. 

    Quick exercise to learn pthreads, uses 4 pthreads to split up work in calculating factorials.
    Because it uses c unsigned long longs, can only handle factorials up until 20 inclusive. 
    Also made a short bash script to test and compare outcome against correct factorials.
